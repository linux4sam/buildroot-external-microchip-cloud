      This code repository produces two libraries:
      
      libp11 provides a higher-level (compared to the PKCS#11 library) 
      interface to access PKCS#11 objects. It is designed to integrate with 
      applications that use OpenSSL.

      pkcs11 engine plugin for the OpenSSL library allows accessing PKCS#11
      modules in a semi-transparent way.

      The wiki page for this project is at https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11/wiki
      and includes a bug tracker and source browser.
